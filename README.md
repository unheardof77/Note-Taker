# Note Taker [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This application is a note taker that saves notes to a mock database so that they can be accessed later.  This can help manage a busy schedule.  By having an application that saves notes, you can take notes in class or just write reminders through-out the day.  This takes off some of the mental stress of having to remember everything you need to study or ask more about.  I was given starter code for this assignment.  The starter code was a fully working front end.  My task was to take this existing front end, and add a back end.  I did this using express.js.  I also organized the files using molecular routing.  This allows for more organized files and a smoother future development.
